Class Notes-10
Actions Class:

* Actions class is used to do advanced user interactions like mouse hover, double click, drag and drop etc.
* Actions class is a class comes from selenium and is created by passing the webdriver object as constructor.
    //perform() --> perform the action, complete the action
    //moveToElement --> move you mouse to webelement(hover over)

- JavaScript Executor:
    When we cannot solve our issue with selenium, we can use javascript if other options does not work
    like clicking, sendkeys, also scroll up and down..

  FILE UPLOAD:

How to upload file manually ?
1.Click on the button(choose file) which opens file explorer using which we choose file
2.Click another button(upload) which completes the uploading

 How to get the Path of the file ?
    MAC:
    1.Right click on the file
    2.Hold option key
    3.Select option Copy "file.txt" as Pathname
    WINDOWS:
    1.Hold Shift button
    2.Right click on file
    3.Copy as Path

 Create resources:
    1.Right click on test (NOT TESTS)
    2.New->Directory
    3.Choose resources or type:resources
    4.OK

Create a test file:
    1.Right click on resources
    2.New->File
    3.name: testfile.txt

- In order to create dynamic path of the files that we are using in our tests cases,
  we have to locate our project folder dynamically.

 String projectPath = System.getProperty("user.dir");
* This method will find where your project is located in your computer.

* Then we will add the relative file path which is after project location;
       String filePath = "src/test/resources/textFile.txt";

and finally we will concat those two and give as a absolute path to sendKeys method.
String fullPath = projectPath+"/"+filePath;


FILE DOWNLOAD
Using selenium we cannot verify the content of the downloaded files.
we can got to some websites, click on the links to download files using selenium.
But we cannot verify the content.
Using java+othre libraries/dependencies we can verify if the file exists and verify the content.
