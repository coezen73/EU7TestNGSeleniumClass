Class Notes-9
TAB AND WINDOWS:

In selenium, there is no difference between tabs and windows. By default selenium controls one html page.
When we open the page first time, it points that page only.
When we open a new tab/window, it will still be looking at the old window.
To do any interaction with the new window we have to switch to new window.

driver.getWindowHandle(); --> This returns some unique code belongs the windows that we open with driver.get()

handle--> unique identifier for windows
driver.getWindowHandle() --> returns the handle of the current windows
driver.getWindowHandles()--> returns the set of the all open windows.

HOW TO HANDLE MORE THEN 2 WINDOWS/TABS in SELENIUM:

If you have more then 2 windows, we need some unique identifier for us like title, url etc.
Then based on our identifier we will keep switching windows until we find our expected window.

==============================

FRAMES:
NoSuchElementException:
    1.Locator might be wrong(dynamic or not correct)
    2.Not enough wait time
    3.Frame or iframe // it s same for us..

In html we can have one html page inside to another. This is made possible by tag <iframe> or <frame>.
Using frames we can put html inside the html. When we have page with frames,
selenium cannot control what is inside the frame. We have to switch iframe first.
When we switch to iframe, it will not see the default page, until we switched back.

-We can only switch one at a time, cannot switch to grandchild directly.
-Cannot switch to siblings, only parent to child

    HTML(Default Content)
        0 frame-top(parent frame)
            0 left
            1 middle
            2 right
        1 frame-bottom

====================================
WAITS

Thread.sleep()
this method is from java, not selenium. It pauses the program based on given millisecond.

It waits for the duration given. Be careful not to use too long or too less.
It is recommended to minimize the use of thread.'sleep' using too much slows the execution of tests.

IMPLICITLY WAIT:

driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(20,TimeUnit.SECONDS);

This  'wait' comes from selenium.Two parameters:
1.Amount of time
2.Unit of time(second,milliseconds,days etc)

HOW FIND ELEMENT METHODS WORK ?
 We provide locator and try to find element to do same actions using findElement method
   IF element FOUND  -> It will return WebElement
   IF element does NOT FOUND;
a) It will check do we have implicitly wait set ?
     -It will keep trying to find element up to time we set.
        1.If it finds within the time, it will return the element.
        2.If it cannot find up to time we set, it will throw NoSuchElementException
b) If there is no implicitly wait set, it will throw 'NoSuchElementException'

* This waits for elements to be found in HTML, It only works when we call 'findElement'
  method.
* Implicitly wait only waits until the element located.
* Implicitly wait is set once, then it is used by rest of the program.
* If we have many findElement methods, they will all use the same implicitlyWait.

    As long as findElement method finds the webElement on the html,
    it does NOT care is it intractable, visible, clickable or not. it will return the element.
    So implicitly wait will not solve our elementNotInteractible problems.

    IF ELEMENT IN THE HTML, findElement WILL NOT COMPLAIN.
==========================================================================

EXPLICITLY WAIT:

Sometimes we might locate the element, but we cannot interact with it within a certain time.
We have to wait until it is visible, clickable, enabled,has certain text or disappear.
When we have to wait for these cases, we will use EXPLICIT wait.

- 2 step to use explicit wait: first create the object pass parameters:

WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver,10);

WebDriverWait --> clas used to explicit waits
It takes 2 parameters: driver, time in seconds

use object to wait until specific conditions for webElement or case.

wait.until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(inputBox));

ExpectedConditions-->contains conditions for wait that we can wait using WebDriverWait

Depending on what condition we are using, we can pass webElement,by locator or text to ExpectedConditions.

Explicit wait, waits for the condition to complete, once the condition is met, it will stop waiting(dynamic).
If the condition is not met and the time runs out we got TimeoutException

COMPARISON OF 3 WAITS:

Thread.sleep
call every time you need
wait for whole duration, not dynamic(static)
not selenium wait

IMPLICITLY WAIT
call it once,(set of driver)
waits while trying to findElement
wait until element found or time runs out(dynamic)
applies for all findElement methods

EXPLICITLY WAIT
call every time you need it
wait until condition is met or time runs out(dynamic)
waits for different conditions(interactible,visible,invisible,text,clickable etc)
